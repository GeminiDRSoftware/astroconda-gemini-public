# The original rvsao tarball had problems on OSX because it contains a
# name that is duplicated on non-case-sensitive filesystems, namely a
# symbolic link "templates -> Templates/". For the UR, the tarball has been
# re-generated with the symbolic link removed and the directory renamed
# to "templates" (grep shows that the capitalized name isn't used anywhere).

# Delete a dangling symbolic link that causes conda-build great offence:
rm -f Util/Old/shdr.h

# cd rvsao  # Pre-2.15
mkpkg update

# In Ureka, this script used to call make_all from the stsci_iraf tarball but
# in AstroConda, the applicable parts of make_all are instead included here, to
# accommodate stsci_iraf being split into separate conda packages:

status=0

#ls -la
pwd

# Execute the build. We probably don't need a subshell now that we're working
# directly in the subdirectory:
echo report: STECF
mkpkg $IRAFARCH                   || status=1
mkpkg -p tables -p stsdas update  || status=1
chmod g+r */*.e                   || status=1

# Proprietary code now gets removed by build_iraf_package. For stsci_iraf the
# conda recipe copies the (separately-maintained) list to the right place first.

exit $status
